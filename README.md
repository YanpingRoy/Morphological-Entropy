This program implements an approach to calculate morphological entropy.
You can run the 'START ANALYSIS.m' in Matlab to compute a metric for measuring the irregularity and elongation of a given object, such as cell, nulceus, and cell spheroid.
You can run the 'CROSS_CORRELATION.m' to calculate the correlation between two data series, such as the radial and augular displacements for single cell.
The 'CORRELATION_COEFFICIENT.m' and 'STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.m' are written to study the statistical differences between the given groups.
Please note that you need to prepare the data (i.e., the figures) and change the root directory in the code (see line 16).
